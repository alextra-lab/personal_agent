# Documentation Quality Standards

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Universal Checks (All Docs)
- [ ] **Purpose** stated explicitly in introduction
- [ ] **Scope** defined (what's in/out)
- [ ] **Version/date** present
- [ ] **Consistent** with existing docs (no contradictions)
- [ ] **Decisions justified** (not just "what" but "why")
- [ ] **Tradeoffs explicit** (acknowledges costs)
- [ ] **Next steps clear** (actionable)
- [ ] **No personal info** (use "project owner" not names)

### ADR Requirements
- [ ] **Status** (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
- [ ] **Context** (problem/need driving decision)
- [ ] **Decision** (chosen solution clearly stated)
- [ ] **At least 2 alternatives** considered (not just one option)
- [ ] **Consequences** (positive and negative impacts)
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria** (how to know it's done)

### Spec Requirements
- [ ] **Interfaces documented** (APIs, protocols, data formats)
- [ ] **Error handling** strategy specified
- [ ] **Observability** integrated (telemetry, logging)
- [ ] **MVP scope boundary** stated (what's in/out for Phase 1)
- [ ] **Open questions** listed (honest about unknowns)

### Experiment Requirements
- [ ] **Hypothesis** stated as testable claim
- [ ] **Metrics** defined (how success/failure measured)
- [ ] **Baseline** established (current state)
- [ ] **Success criteria** quantified (threshold for adoption)
- [ ] **Results section** exists (populated after run)

## Red Flags (Reject if Present)

- ❌ **No alternatives** (only one option presented)
- ❌ **No tradeoffs** (decision presented as pure win)
- ❌ **Vague decision** (can't extract clear "we will do X")
- ❌ **No rationale** (decision without "why")
- ❌ **Contradicts existing ADRs** (without acknowledging supersession)

## Quality Tiers

- **Tier 1 (Publishable)**: Passes all checks, no red flags, external contributor could implement
- **Tier 2 (Internal Use)**: Passes most checks, minor gaps acceptable
- **Tier 3 (Draft)**: Fails multiple checks, needs revision

**Aim for Tier 1 for all ADRs and core specs.**
