# File Organization Rules

## Root Level Policy

### ✅ Allowed at Root
- Project config: `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.gitignore`
- Essential docs: `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
- Essential directories: `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `config/`

### ❌ Not Allowed at Root
- Session logs → `docs/plans/sessions/`
- Action items → `docs/plans/`
- Validation checklists → `docs/`
- PR review rubrics → `docs/`
- Vision documents → `docs/`
- Directory structure docs → `docs/`
- Temporary files → Delete or move to appropriate location

## File Placement Guide

| File Type | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| Session logs | `docs/plans/sessions/` |
| Action items | `docs/plans/` |
| Implementation plans | `docs/plans/` |
| Architecture specs | `docs/architecture/` |
| ADRs | `docs/architecture_decisions/` |
| Research notes | `docs/research/` |
| Process docs | `docs/` |
| Source code | `src/personal_agent/` |
| Tests | `tests/` |
| Runtime config | `config/` (gitignored except templates) |
| Telemetry data | `telemetry/` (gitignored) |

## When Unsure

1. **Is it essential for project setup?** (config files) → Root
2. **Is it the first thing newcomers need?** (README) → Root
3. **Is it process/quality documentation?** → `docs/`
4. **Is it planning/tracking?** → `docs/plans/`
5. **Is it architecture/design?** → `docs/architecture/` or `docs/architecture_decisions/`
6. **Is it code?** → `src/`
7. **Is it research?** → `docs/research/`

**When in doubt, NOT at root.**
