# PR Review Standards

## Quick Reference

### Blocking Issues (Must Fix)
- 🚨 Problem unclear or non-existent
- 🚨 Solution technically unsound (score < 3)
- 🚨 Security risk identified
- 🚨 No observability plan (for system components)
- 🚨 Violates core principles

### High Priority (Fix Before Merge)
- 🔴 No alternatives listed (ADRs)
- 🔴 Consequences incomplete
- 🔴 Testing strategy vague
- 🔴 Scope too large

### Medium Priority (Can Fix Post-Approval)
- ⚠️ Documentation needs polish
- ⚠️ Minor consistency issues

## Review Categories

1. **Problem Clarity** - Is the problem/need clearly stated?
2. **Solution Quality** - Is it sound, implementable, aligned with principles? (0-5 scale)
3. **Alternatives** - At least 2 alternatives considered with tradeoffs?
4. **Consequences** - Positive and negative impacts identified?
5. **Observability** - How will this be monitored/debugged?
6. **Security & Safety** - Governance integrated, safe failure modes?
7. **Testing Strategy** - How will this be tested? Acceptance criteria?
8. **Documentation** - Well-documented, clear, consistent?
9. **Scope & Complexity** - Reasonable scope, not over-engineered?
10. **Consistency** - Aligns with project principles?

## Decision Thresholds

- **Auto-Approve**: All blocking items Pass, Solution Quality ≥ 4
- **Approve with Conditions**: 1-2 High Priority items need fixes
- **Request Revisions**: Multiple High Priority failures OR Solution Quality < 3
- **Reject**: Any Blocking item fails OR fundamental principle violation
