# Session Orientation Protocol

## When Starting a Development Session

Before beginning any implementation work, orient yourself:

1. **Query Linear** via MCP (`plugin-linear-linear`) — call `list_projects` for stream status, `list_issues` for current work items
2. **Read the relevant spec** (e.g., `docs/plans/PHASE_2.3_PLAN.md`) for implementation details
3. **Check recent session logs** in `docs/plans/sessions/` for context from the last session

If Linear MCP is unavailable, fall back to `docs/plans/DEV_TRACKER.md` for project links and completed phases.

## When Implementing a Linear Issue

1. **Read the issue** via `get_issue` — the description contains: spec path, files to modify, acceptance criteria
2. **Read the linked spec** for full implementation details
3. **Reference ADRs** in `docs/architecture_decisions/` for architectural constraints
4. **Implement, test, and update** the issue status via `update_issue`

## When Completing Work

1. **Update the Linear issue** — move to Done via `update_issue` with `state: "Done"`
2. **Update ADR statuses** if an architectural decision was implemented or superseded
3. **Log significant sessions** following the template in `docs/plans/sessions/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`

## When Making Architectural Decisions

1. Check existing ADRs in `docs/architecture_decisions/` for prior decisions
2. Create new ADRs following the established format (see ADR-0016 as exemplar)
3. Create a Linear issue to track the decision
