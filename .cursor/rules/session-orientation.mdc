# Session Orientation Protocol

## When Starting a Development Session

Before beginning any implementation work, orient yourself:

1. **Read `docs/plans/DEV_TRACKER.md`** — Quick status, active work items, documentation debt
2. **Read the relevant phase plan** (e.g., `docs/plans/PHASE_2.3_PLAN.md`) for current implementation details
3. **Check recent session logs** in `docs/plans/sessions/` for context from the last session

## When Completing Work

1. **Update `docs/plans/DEV_TRACKER.md`** — Move items between sections, update completion percentages
2. **Update ADR statuses** if an architectural decision was implemented or superseded
3. **Log significant sessions** following the template in `docs/plans/sessions/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`

## When Making Architectural Decisions

1. Check existing ADRs in `docs/architecture_decisions/` for prior decisions
2. Create new ADRs following the established format (see ADR-0016 as exemplar)
3. Update the Decision Log in `docs/plans/DEV_TRACKER.md`
