# Architecture & Design Decisions

This directory contains:

- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Hypotheses and experiments
- Risk and tradeoff analyses
- Requirements traceability

These documents capture **why** the agent is designed the way it is.

Runtime governance and policy (what the agent is allowed to do) will live under `governance/`.
