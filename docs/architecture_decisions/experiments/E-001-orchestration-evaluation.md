# E-001 — Orchestration Reliability & Explainability

Purpose:
Test whether graph-first orchestration delivers traceable, explainable, and controllable execution.

Hypothesis:
Linked to H-001

Method:

- Implement baseline orchestration graph.
- Run representative tasks:
  - coding task
  - system observation task
  - research task
- Trigger:
  - normal runs
  - forced failure scenarios
  - unexpected branching

Metrics:

- ability to replay execution sequence
- clarity of logged reasoning
- incident debugging time
- number of uncontrolled transitions

Outcome Criteria:
See H-001 success conditions

Status: Planned
