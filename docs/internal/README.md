# Internal Documentation

This directory contains internal development notes, session logs, and internal processes that are primarily for development and maintenance purposes.

## Purpose

This directory is reserved for:
- Development session logs
- Internal process documentation
- Maintenance notes
- Temporary documentation during development

## Structure

This directory may be organized by topic or date as needed. Currently, most session logs are maintained in the `plans/sessions/` directory.
