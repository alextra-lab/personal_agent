> **Last updated**: 2026-06-28 (master — **FRE-654 SHIPPED (PR #270, Done)** — ADR-0100 broad-path seam (`query_memory_broad` / MEMORY_RECALL intent): adds `query_text` (threaded protocol→adapter→context→executor) + vector-relevant entity candidates across all time, 90-day cutoff demoted to a ranking signal; flag-gated default-off (prod no-op). **Both recall paths now land.** Focused master review (all 6 FRE-653 defect classes checked clean — ordered cap, floor-on-ranking, scoped on query_text; MATCH-only, parameterized) + AC-1b control/proof run green on :7688 (38 tests, no regression); merged on focused pass not the 40-agent workflow (smaller/dormant; FRE-655 A/B is the backstop over both paths). **No deploy** (deferred to FRE-655). **FRE-655 now UNBLOCKED** (assembled seam: A/B on FRE-489 + floor/cutoff calibration WITH OWNER + flag rollout + live verify) — owner-involved; gateway rebuild + additive-ES-template ride along at the flag-flip. Prior 06-28: **FRE-653 SHIPPED (PR #268, Done)** — ADR-0100 core de-gate on `query_memory`, flag-gated default-off (prod no-op until FRE-655 flips it). **Bounced once then merged**: round-1 master review (high-effort 40-agent code-review workflow + security + AC runs) caught **6 confirmed flag-on correctness defects** the green AC tests structurally couldn't (single-seed) — incl. an unordered `candidate_cap` slice that reintroduced the very "no prior discussions" miss; round-2 fixed all 6 + added the **multi-turn crowding proof test** (master ran it green on :7688) + promoted caps to config; `recency_days`-under-flag contract documented + caller-audit tracked as **FRE-658**. **No deploy** (dormant flag; gateway rebuild + additive-ES-template registration deferred to FRE-655's flag-flip). **FRE-654 now unblocked** (broad-path seam; build kept context). Follow-ups Needs-Approval: **FRE-657** (identity-hook false-positive), **FRE-658** (explicit-window recall semantics). Prior 06-28: **ADR-0100 Memory Recall — Relevance-Bounded Candidate Generation merged Proposed (PR #267)** — the routed Phase-2 recall fix (FRE-494): replace recency-keyed candidate generation with **vector top-k over `entity_embedding` across all time** + a calibrated config-driven `recall_similarity_floor`; recency demoted to a ranking weight; returned set sorted by combined relevance (fixes a 3rd defect — scores computed but discarded for ordering). **Answers the owner's volumetry/perf constraint**: top-k bounds the candidate set (scale-invariant), staleness delegated to ADR-0098 Claims. Flag-gated default-off → A/B on FRE-489 → live verify (FRE-433 discipline). **ADR-0100 Accepted (owner) + impl chain Approved**: **FRE-653** core de-gate [S] → **FRE-654** broad-path seam [S] → **FRE-655** assembled SEAM (A/B + floor/cutoff calibration w/ owner + rollout + live verify) [O] — all **Approved → build**; **FRE-656** embedder/reranker benchmark [O] held Needs-Approval (gated behind 655). **Seam owner = FRE-655**; ADR-0100 closes only when 655 proves AC-1a…AC-7 live with the flag on, then FRE-435 can close. Doc-drift reconciled: **FRE-435 reopened In Progress** (was prematurely Done 06:47 — Phase 2 designed, not shipped); **FRE-493 closed Done** (research doc on main via FRE-491 + recommendation realized in ADR-0100). **FRE-491 closed Done** (owner signed off the V6 reframing: recall failure is structural — the verified hard 30-day recency-gate — so numeric cutoff calibration is unneeded; H4 dominant gate named with code proof; carve-outs FRE-646/490/647 remain; parent FRE-435 stays In Progress). **Highest-leverage next move = recency de-gate (Phase-2), to be framed in adr.** **FRE-631 + FRE-634 Canceled** (owner-approved, redundant with the Approved ADR-0098 wave): 634 = first-write-wins correctability, fully carried by **FRE-638** (retire-FWW + Claims/bitemporal); 631 = ADR-0071 curation gate, but **ADR-0071 is Superseded** (its accept-precondition is unsatisfiable) and the gate is carried by **FRE-639 + FRE-638**. ADR-0071 file status confirmed already Superseded-marked. Prior 06-28: **ADR-0099 Configuration Management & Validation Accepted (owner; PR #266)** — single-source role matrix + tiered validator + profile-divergence policy; impl chain **FRE-648→649→650 Approved** (648 audit=head · 649 guard+drift-correction[local nano→mini] · 650 generative loader), **651/652 to follow** (seam = FRE-652; **FRE-649 is an owner-visible local config change: entity_extraction nano→mini, captains_log/insights →sonnet**). **FRE-645 eval-fidelity guard shipped (PR #265, Done)** — harness pinned to prod model-config + divergence guard; first instance of ADR-0099. **Worktree-branch hygiene permanently fixed**: rebase-before-PR (build/adr) + delete-on-merge (master) + GitHub "Main" ruleset (block force-push/delete) + auto-delete-head-branches on. Earlier 06-28: **FRE-491 recall baseline integrated (PR #264).** The owner's "no prior discussions" symptom = a **verified deterministic 30-day recall recency-gate** (`recency_days=30`, `protocol.py`→`service.py`) upstream of vector/reranker — **model-independent, deterministically fixable**; H4 query-layer is the dominant gate, embeddings + write-path are NOT the bottleneck. **Highest-leverage next move = recency de-gate (Phase-2, owner flagged possible urgency).** FRE-491 held In Progress (V#6 owner sign-off pending); carve-outs **FRE-646** (extract-tax, needs budget OK) · FRE-490 · FRE-647. FRE-488 was Done-but-broken (harness couldn't measure recall — fixed). **FRE-645 canceled** (dup of FRE-646 + FRE-644). Prior this session: **Config Management & Validation initiative filed**: **FRE-644** ADR [Approved → adr] + **FRE-645** eval-model-config-fidelity [Approved → build; **blocks FRE-491**]. Root finding: config sprawled across `.env`/3 model-YAMLs/governance/compose/container-env with no single source of truth + **undeclared local↔cloud model-role drift** (extraction nano/mini · captains_log+insights nano/sonnet; embedding+reranker consistent). Principle: switch swaps the inference brain only; cognitive-pipeline roles consistent; evals always on prod config; guard the rest. Parameter-manager **UI deferred** (PWA Config Console). Also: read-only Bash perms made permanent; test substrate reset clean+current for the FRE-491 baseline.) 2026-06-27 (master — **ADR-0087 Accepted** (owner; recall-measurement program — reconciled w/ 0098: gate-3 markdown/LLM-wiki *substrate* dropped; Phase-1 tickets **FRE-490/491/493 Approved**, **FRE-494 held [GATED]**). **ADR-0096 Accepted** (owner; memory access model — chain FRE-613–618 still Needs-Approval). Earlier: **owner greenlit the ADR-0098 stream**: ADR-0098 **Accepted**; build wave **FRE-637–642 Approved** (637 head, extraction-first; 642 seam); **FRE-643** Tier-3 deferred-with-trigger; **FRE-467** spatio-temporal location memory Approved + moved to Memory Recall Quality.

## Current State

Waves A ✅ B ✅ C ✅ E ✅ J ✅ complete. Wave H: FRE-375/374/376 ✅ — FRE-377 next, FRE-381 pending approval. Wave I (FRE-403 EPIC) ✅ COMPLETE — P0–P5 (FRE-404–409) all shipped+verified 2026-06-02; P6 (DSPy opt) optional. **ADR-0081 cache chain COMPLETE:** D1 ✅ (FRE-422) → D4 ✅ (FRE-431) → D2/D3 ✅ (FRE-434, PRs #129/#130) — frozen append-only layout + cache-aware scheduler shipped, A/B-verified (local cross-turn reuse 0 → 8,110+; cloud 13,916 → 19,542; quality flat), **enabled in prod**. FRE-433 spike root-caused it to gateway head-layout. Follow-ups (Needs Approval): FRE-435 (memory research), FRE-436/437/438/439/440. ADR-0074 fully Accepted. ADR-0075/0076/0077/0079/0080 Implemented; ADR-0082 (tier-routing) Proposed → FRE-432 Approved.

Wave D implementation (endpoint abstraction, compose unification, test parity) remains deferred per FRE-214 audit §8.7.

## Program Architecture (L0–L3) — `docs/specs/SESHAT_PROGRAM_ARCHITECTURE.md`

As of 2026-06-06 (FRE-504) the portfolio is organized as **substrate pillars vs feature consumers** across four layers. This is the forward-looking organizing layer over the legacy Wave A–J sequence (below, retained as historical record). Live Linear projects map to layers:

| Layer | Linear project(s) | Role |
|-------|-------------------|------|
| **L0 — Observability substrate** | **Telemetry Surface Audit** (NEW, Approved 2026-06-08) — ES mapping↔code↔dashboard reconciliation; FRE-533 (A1, Opus) → 534/535 → 536–539; local infra, session held. · **Observability Foundation** — 451 taxonomy ✅ · 452 ledger ✅ · 506 gate telemetry ✅ · 513 ADR-0088 spine ✅ · 514 REST read ✅ · 515 delegate used/discarded ✅ · 519 sub-agent read surface ✅ · 505 sub-agent auditability ✅ (verified+closed 06-08) · **453** eval set re-sequenced → blocked by **541** (driver) · **OPEN (Approved):** 518 live-render gap (High bug) · 517 per-topology rows · 523 eval-mode memory pipeline (bug) · 522 eval⇄PWA reconciliation · **Needs Approval:** 541 eval conversation driver + `clarification_requested` (Opus, blocks 453) | Makes *actual* traversal observable; gates reconciliation + shipping-to-default. Governed by **ADR-0088** (Accepted). |
| **L1 — Intended-traversal matrix** | *(folded into Observability Foundation)* — FRE-453 + knowledge-access column + decomposed build/teach case | Normative spec; authored *in parallel* with L0 (declaring intent needs no telemetry). |
| **L2 — Substrate pillars** | **Memory Recall Quality** (ADR-0087 **Accepted 2026-06-27**) · **Seshat Inference Architecture** (ADR-0082 — plumbing + planner reliability, incl. **FRE-502**) · **ADR-0081 Extended — Context & Memory Injection Quality** · **Artifact Execution Security** (ADR-0089 **Implemented 2026-06-07** — core 509✅510✅511✅512✅ live+verified; **Addendum A merged** PR #188 = curated `/lib/` toolkit → impl tickets FRE-526–532 Approved; FRE-524/498 canceled, FRE-497 re-homed) | Cross-cutting capabilities with many consumers. All three live pillars **Approved**. |
| **L3 — Consumers** | **Seshat Pedagogical Architecture** · **Turn Cost & Latency Optimization** · **Turn Reliability Hardening** | Features standing on the substrate. |

**Reconciliation loop (L0↔L1):** intended matrix vs actual ledger; every gap resolved loudly in one of two explicit directions ("loud or it rots"). Currently a *principle*, not yet a running control system (operationalizing it is itself a future L0/L1 deliverable).

**Active sequence — visibility-first (decomposition first-run fix queue):** Wave 0 (SEE) = **FRE-501 ✅** (live cost+status meter, PR #171, deployed) · FRE-505 · FRE-506 — *build/adr*. Wave 1 = FRE-502 (planner reliability). Wave 2 = FRE-503 (proactive depth for build/teach). Parallel = FRE-500 (sandbox flag bridge). adr = **FRE-504** ✅ **done** (spec PR #172; ADR-0088 Accepted · 0089 Implemented · 0090 Proposed — all landed; closed 2026-06-08, threads 2/3/7 routed to Memory Recall / Inference pillars).

**Reconciliation — RESOLVED by adr session (2026-06-06; do not re-resolve):**
1. **FRE-502** (planner reliability) — ✅ **MOVED** to **Seshat Inference Architecture** (spec §4 mechanism-robustness routing); was in Turn Cost.
2. **Artifact Execution Security** (L2 pillar, ADR-0089) — **deferred by design**: creating the project + re-homing FRE-497/498/499/500 (currently Turn Cost) happens at **ADR-0089 authoring** (adr session), since the ADR defines the pillar's shape — creating it now would approve a boundary before its ADR. No master action; tracked interim.
3. **FRE-453** — **resolved, no change**: filed in **Observability Foundation**, which owns the L1 matrix. L0 and L1 are **co-located** (the two halves of the reconciliation loop; there is no separate L1 project) — so it *is* "with L1." Optional future polish (owner's call): two milestones ("L0 — Observation" / "L1 — Intended matrix") to make the split visible.
4. **3 pillars approve** — ✅ **DONE**: Memory Recall Quality, Seshat Inference Architecture, ADR-0081 Extended all **Approved** (restructure pass, owner-authorized).

*Restructure provenance:* Observability Foundation created (Approved); lifted FRE-451/452/453 (from Pedagogical M2), FRE-505 (from Turn Cost), FRE-506 (no prior project) into it.

*Re-home pass (2026-06-10, owner-authorized — "easier to trace and sequence"):* the two near-complete incident projects (**Turn Cost & Latency** ~72% closed, **Turn Reliability Hardening** ~63% closed) stay as-is to wind down; only the open tickets with a clear dependency home moved out — **FRE-507** (event-driven cost streaming) → **Observability Foundation** (ADR-0088 D3 / ADR-0076 lineage; reassess vs what FRE-513 already shipped at the cost boundary); **FRE-495** (local sub_agent context_length), **FRE-472** (conversational capability-trap research), **FRE-492** (HITL dynamic allow-gate for discovery sub-agents) → **Seshat Inference Architecture**. Left in place as general turn-work: FRE-477/487 (Turn Cost ergonomics), FRE-497/474 (Turn Reliability). Not folded into the 3 active substrate pillars (different charter; would dilute scope + lose incident provenance).

## Active Design Threads

Four threads carved from the FRE-389 on-device review (2026-05-28). All **Approved**. FRE-398 (bubble-up errors) ✅ Done.

| Thread | Issue | Scope |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Dynamic artifacts** | [FRE-397](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-397) | Diagrams now → interactive later (Tier 1 SVG → Tier 2 sandboxed JS → Tier 3 JSX). |
| **Adaptive limits & error recovery** | [FRE-399](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-399) | ~~524 root cause fixed (`cbd6f45`).~~ Layer 3 ✅ (ADR-0083, PR #139): cross-tunnel SLM health monitor, enriched `/api/inference/status`, executor error-reason hint. Children: FRE-444 (Mac-side enrichment), FRE-443 (L2 cloud fallback — gate: genuine failure observed), FRE-445 (dynamic thresholds, coordinate FRE-391). |
| **E2E testing (transport/UI/error)** | [FRE-400](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-400) ✅ Done | PR1 ✅ (PR #140): WS harness + 16 tests + CI. PR2 ✅ (PR #141): 59 Vitest component+hook tests. PR3 ✅ (PR #142): 4 Playwright e2e browser tests. FRE-390 closed (subsumed). |
| **Planner-executor split** | [FRE-401](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-401) | Reasoning model plans; subagents execute in isolated context. ADR required before implementation. |

**Recommended order**: FRE-434 ✅ → FRE-377 ✅ → FRE-408 ✅ → FRE-409 ✅ → FRE-399 L3 ✅ → FRE-400 ✅ (3/3 PRs) → **[FRE-384](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-384) / [FRE-383](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-383) (next — High bugs)** → FRE-432 → FRE-397 Tier 2.

**Standalone (Approved)**: FRE-394 (PWA SW dead code), FRE-395 (PWA ESLint).

## Pending Verification

- **FRE-557** ✅ DONE (2026-06-26, read-only) — `agent-monitors-projector-health-*` has 12 docs, all `observation_complete:true`; cross-checked `model_calls_received == COUNT(api_costs WHERE trace_id)` on 4 latest traces → 4/4 MATCH. Master fired no turns.
- **FRE-523** ✅ DONE (2026-06-26) — closed on **AC-1/2/4** (the diff's write-path change: pipeline-on-during-eval + provenance + Linear-leak-closed; verified read-only — 26 KG `Turn` nodes `eval_mode:true`, trace `4612bff6` present, 30 ES eval captures, external gate intact). **AC-3 (cross-run recall) re-homed to FRE-435** (owner decision) — it tests the *retrieval* path FRE-523 never touched; substrate pre-loaded, probe ready, gated on an owner-run/authorized eval pass-2. *(Gotcha logged: Neo4j `eval_mode` is nested in the Turn's JSON-string `properties`, not a top-level prop — `t.eval_mode` reads NULL.)*
- **FRE-468** ✅ DONE — post-deploy verified 2026-06-04: no Anthropic 400, `cache_read_tokens=17,772` on round 2, `cache_control_cap_enforced` never fired. Fix confirmed live.
- **FRE-473** ✅ DONE — post-deploy verified 2026-06-04: `cache_read_tokens=17,772` unchanged vs FRE-468 baseline; no §D2 regression; persisted history now provider-neutral.
- **FRE-408** ✅ DONE (owner accepted real-telemetry equivalent — 3 buckets on real ES traces). Optional Mac harness smoke remains belt-and-suspenders, not blocking.

## Turn Reliability Hardening (2026-06-04 incident) — winding down (build-to-close)

All five from the `cache_control 5>4` post-mortem (PR #150). FRE-468 is Urgent and first. **2026-06-10:** after the re-home pass (FRE-472 → Inference), the two residuals **FRE-497** (self-correcting gates, ADR) + **FRE-474** (cross-provider cache research) were **Approved** to build-to-close; project closes when both ship. Turn Cost & Latency likewise winds down via **FRE-477** + **FRE-487** (both Approved).

| Ticket | Priority | Tier | What |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| [FRE-468](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-468) ✅ | **Urgent** | Sonnet | **DONE** (PRs #151+#152, `6fb0d2c`) — `_strip_cache_control` + `_enforce_cache_control_cap`; 11 tests; post-mortem amended. **Deploy + verify pending.** |
| [FRE-469](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-469) ✅ | **High** | Sonnet | **DONE** (PR #154, `424c27b`) — `_TOOL_INTENT_PATTERNS` artifact/build extension; verified live: `task_type=tool_use, signals=['tool_intent_pattern']`. |
| [FRE-470](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-470) ✅ | Low | Sonnet | **DONE** (PR #156, `696e5e6`) — exit 141 treated as success only on a top-level pipe (`_has_top_level_pipe`); standalone 141 still fails; `note` field added. 7 unit + 5 real-bash integration tests. Deployed + verified live (code in container, health green). |
| [FRE-471](https://linear.app/frenchforest/issue/FRE-471) ✅ | Low | Sonnet | **DONE** (PR #157, `a259503`) — `_truncate_plan` boundary-aware trim + anti-fabrication notice (never raises on oversize); cap 8000→16000; `plan_truncated`/`plan_original_length` flags; empty plan still raises. Deployed + verified live (`_MAX_PLAN_CHARS=16000` in container, health green). |

### Stream delegation model (owner directive 2026-06-21) — sessions self-dispatch; master is the gateway

Each stream session **runs its own skill and drives its own stream** — the owner no longer hand-feeds tickets one at a time. One level of delegation down from the master↔owner loop:

- **build (Stream A)** and **build2 (Stream B)** each invoke **`/build`** on their own, pull their domain's `Approved` queue, sequence tickets, fan out sub-agents for plan/research/review, and push PRs.
- **adr (worktree-adrs)** invokes **`/adr`** on its own for docs/ADRs.
- **master** remains the **sole gateway into `main`** and the **only deploy approver**: review (code+security) → doc-drift → merge → ask-owner-before-deploy → deploy → verify live → close Linear → MASTER_PLAN. Build/adr never merge, deploy, close, or edit MASTER_PLAN.

**Invariants that make this safe:**
- **Owner owns the Approved gate.** Sessions self-select only from `Approved` (never Needs-Approval). "New == Needs Approval, Implement == Approved" unchanged.
- **File-domain partition** (A = backend/ES/telemetry/gateway · B = PWA/frontend · adr = docs) keeps streams off each other's files on the shared VPS tree. A cross-domain ticket (e.g. ES-template FRE-571 vs FRE-567) routes through master to serialize — never hand two streams tickets that edit the same file.
- **Handoff goes on the ticket.** Each build/adr session writes a **handoff comment on the Linear issue at PR time** — exact deploy command + what to verify live, scope/decision changes, gotchas, follow-ups. Master reads ticket comments at every gate; the thread is the live decision trail (not the PR body).
- **Context disposition is dispatched + self-reported.** Every queued ticket carries a `[model · context]` tag (see legend) so the owner knows whether to `/clear` before it. A session **says in its handoff comment whether it wants its context cleared** before the next ticket (it knows its own context best) — e.g. "FRE-X next: keep — shares the planner refactor" or "done with this area: clear before next." Master pre-annotates from the dependency/file relationship; the session's call wins.

### Two-worktree dispatch (2026-06-13 refresh) — file-domain split, no A/B collision

*Per-ticket tags `[model · context]`. **Model** (Tier→model, MODEL_ROUTING_POLICY): **[O]** Opus · **[S]** Sonnet · **[H]** Haiku — escalate Sonnet→Opus on 3 failed attempts / API-shift. **Context**: **keep** = continue from the prior session (direct follow-on — same files/feature, multi-phase, regression test for what was just built, or depends on a fresh discovery) · **fresh** = `/clear` first (different domain/feature; prior context is large + irrelevant; self-contained from the Approved ticket + plan). Default is **fresh** — `/build` already does a fresh-start reset per ticket; deviate to **keep** only when continuity clearly helps. The session has final say and confirms/overrides keep-vs-clear for the NEXT ticket in its handoff comment.*

**Lane A — Telemetry surface** (ES templates · Kibana · cost_gate · tools governance; local-mostly):
1. FRE-544 ✅ → 2. FRE-559 ✅ → 3. FRE-546 ✅ → 4. FRE-550 ✅ → 5. FRE-556 ✅ → 6. FRE-558 ✅ (deployed, PR #233) → **7. FRE-567 [S]** generic numeric dynamic_template ← next.

**Lane B — Observability/topology/eval/ledger + Artifact** (projector · route-trace ledger · eval harness · artifact_tools · PWA):
1. FRE-545 ✅ → 2. FRE-557 ✅ → 3. FRE-507 ✅ → 4. FRE-568 ✅ → 5. FRE-570 ✅ → 6. FRE-576 ✅ → 7. FRE-577 ✅ → 8. FRE-572 ✅ (deployed, PR #235 — **ADR-0092 cluster closed**) → next: {**571 [H]** ES maps · **573 [S]** PWA two-lane} ← pick; also queued **522 [S]** eval⇄PWA · **542 [S]** PWA dedup · **566 [S]** zero-delivery monitor · **ADR-0091 eval chain** 561→562→563→564→453.

**adr session (worktree-adrs) — observability spec-first (owner: "finish infrastructure + observability first"):**
- ✅ **FRE-541** — **ADR-0091 shipped** (PR #216, Proposed; amends ADR-0084 §D4). Umbrella stays In Progress; impl now in 561–564. → **FRE-561/562/563/564 Approved 2026-06-15** — the eval-validity build chain → **Lane B** (serial: **561** doc-mirror T3 ∥ **562** dataset → **563** driver+detector → **564** report+validation; **564 unblocks FRE-453**).
- ✅ **FRE-554** — **ADR-0092 shipped** (PR #219, Proposed; owner-interviewed). Done. → impl chain **Approved 2026-06-16 → Lane B**: **568** (projector session agg) → **570** (A/B/D markers + 4 fields) → {**571** ES maps · **572** backend monitors · **573** PWA two-lane}. **FRE-569** (mechanism-C carve-out, T1) **HELD** (Needs Approval — owner deferred; C parked). adr session now free.

**Context-compression cross-audit (NEW 2026-06-19, Approved) — project: ADR-0081 Extended.** Surfaced by the owner's external LLM-training-course authoring (`~/github/llm-course`) — a line-by-line read of the shipped compression pipeline against ADR prose. Both `agent-filed`.
- **FRE-576** (T1) — 5 findings: **F2 🐞** within-session recap `SUMMARY_ROLE="system"` is silently dropped by the role-fixer (compression discards its own output) → unify on `assistant` like `build_frozen_reset`; **F3 ⚙️** cost-optimal reset scheduler quality term inert (`quality_slope=0.0` hardwired) → wire/observe (relates to 570/572 quality signal); **F4 📝** dead-by-default `compressed_summary` re-insertion branch (frozen layout) → delete or flag; **F5 📝** "≤200 words" vs `max_tokens=512` reconcile; **F1 → FRE-577**. Touches `within_session_compression.py`/`cache_reset_scheduler.py`/`context_window.py`/`context_compressor.py`. ⚠️ **collides with FRE-570 on `within_session_compression.py`** — serialize (recommend **576 first**: fix the role bug before 570 adds B/D markers).
- **FRE-577** (T2) — long-session **occupancy-curve eval** (EVAL-04's 2.5% is a measurement gap — only 1,625 tokens, never filled the window). **Blocked by FRE-570** (reads the new compaction marker events); **feeds FRE-572** (gateway severity model reasons on un-exercised evidence today). Dep chain: **570 → 577 → 572**.
- Sequencing (**owner 2026-06-19: interleave after 570**): **570 (markers) → 576 (audit fixes) → 577 (occupancy) → 572 (severity consumes the occupancy data)**. 576 serializes after 570 on `within_session_compression.py` (orthogonal logic — 570 = marker emission, 576 = recap role-fix). 576 is Opus-tier (per-finding judgment). Lane B orchestrator/compression sub-stream, not Lane A.

**In flight / parked:**
- ✅ **FRE-560** — Done (PR #214, deployed+verified). KG write pipeline healthy.
- **FRE-523** — In Progress; KG-half AC-1/AC-4 met (560 drained the backlog); only AC-3 (owner-run pass-2) remains (§ Pending Verification).
- **Memory Recall program (FRE-488/489/490/491/493/494)** — **PARKED until the infra+observability streams finish** (owner decision 2026-06-14). Now technically unblocked (560 populates the KG; 488 Approved + meaningful; 493/494 are ADR/research) — re-assess 489–491 when the streams complete.
- Turn Cost/Reliability closes (477/487/497/474) — out of scope; Turn projects wind down separately.

**Collision rules:** topology projector (545/557/507) stays in Lane B, serial — different files from FRE-560 (scheduler/executor/app), so they may run concurrently. PWA is shared (522/542/554) — one lane owns it at a time, bump `CACHE_NAME` on shell deploys. `pytest` lock = one `make test`. Merge server-side; deploy one-at-a-time from main.

**Capstone (LAST, either worktree once free):** **FRE-555** flip reconciliation checker → hard CI gate — **gated on ALL emit-gaps merged** (544/545/546/550/558/559). Closes Telemetry Surface Audit + realizes ADR-0090 D5.

**Stream C — Dependency-security remediation (SOLO, NOW — owner re-prioritized 2026-06-19: "Pausing A and B — Stream C takes priority"):**
- **FRE-578 [S] ✅ Done + deployed** (PRs #224 Python + #225 PWA, `1063820`) — 1 critical (litellm auth-bypass) + 7 high (pyjwt, starlette ×2, cryptography, python-multipart, undici, vite) all cleared; **Dependabot crit+high → 0**; starlette major bump booted clean; uv `override-dependencies` for transitive floors.
- **FRE-579 [S] ← next (Approved):** second pass — 24 moderate + 12 low (now ~17 mod + 7 low after 578's transitive clears). Python (aiohttp≥3.14.1 / idna≥3.15 / pip≥26.1; **diskcache no upstream fix → document**) PR + PWA (dompurify/katex/brace-expansion/js-yaml; **katex `--force` needs owner OK**) PR. Solo, branches off `1063820`. Acceptance: open alerts ≤12 (lows) or documented rationale.
- Runs **solo** (one worktree — shared lockfiles, isolated verification). **Lanes A/B PAUSED** (FRE-550 / FRE-570 held mid-queue) until Stream C drains (579).

**Session assignment now (2026-06-26):** Queue drained — Telemetry Surface Audit CAPSTONE (FRE-555) + ADR-0092 both complete. **Target = Seshat Pedagogical Architecture**; per the North Star spec (ADR-0084 §Verification "M2 gate"), **M3 is gated behind M2** (turn-labeling with orchestration **and** pedagogical-outcome events + the canonical eval set) and behind the **KG-write pipeline working** (Layer-1 prerequisite, North Star §7). So the road is:
> - **adr session → `/adr` ADR-0095 next** (grammar-constrained delegation + sub-agent sizing — ADR-0094 ✅ merged PR #247 defers per-call to it) → then **ADR-0096** (memory access model) + **DOC-4** note. Context: review plan `the-following-information-comes-logical-pie.md` §4. Design-only, parallel.
> - **build → Lane A (backend): FRE-598 ✅ + FRE-521 ✅ deployed → `/build FRE-591` next** (sessions.user_id BUG, High — verify live `\d sessions` read-only first; fix init.sql + migrations/0011) → **FRE-605** (persist 3 ephemeral telemetry dirs, Approved) → then the **M2 eval-instrument chain ADR-0091: FRE-561 → 562 → 563 → 564** (564 unblocks FRE-453) — the gate to M3.
> - **build2 → Lane B (PWA): FRE-521 ✅ deployed → `/build FRE-236` next** (iOS background / WS-reconnect resilience, High — reframe the stale "SSE" wording to WS per ADR-0075) · alts FRE-369 (uploads) / FRE-394 (SW cleanup); PWA queue thinning → may pivot to the eval chain.

Self-dispatch model live. Lanes file-disjoint → parallel. **ADR-0092 ✅ Implemented**; Telemetry Surface Audit ✅ complete (FRE-599 reindex trails). Open follow-ups: FRE-599, the 2 Dependabot alerts (Security).

**Collision rule:** anything touching the topology projector/ledger (517, 548) stays in B and serial. PWA is shared (522/532/PWA-side of 551) — one lane at a time. `pytest` lock = one `make test` at a time. Master merges server-side + deploys one-at-a-time from main.

- **Lane T — Telemetry** (local ES/Kibana; **no prod deploy**): FRE-533 ✅ (1023-row inventory) → FRE-534 ✅ (templates corrected + applied+verified live, PR #194) ‖ FRE-535 (dashboard triage) **← buildable** → FRE-536/537/538/539 (cost · ledger+topology · joinability+SLM-health · turn/E2E/envelope) **← now unblocked**.
- **Lane A — Artifact toolkit** (ADR-0089 Add. A merged, PR #188): FRE-526 ✅ → FRE-527 ✅ (`/lib` hosted + `verify-lib` green) → {FRE-528 prompt ‖ FRE-529 skill ‖ FRE-530 export} **← buildable now** → FRE-531 (E2E); FRE-532 (PWA) independent. FRE-525 umbrella closes with FRE-531.
- **Lane O — Observability**: FRE-518 ✅ (live-render bug, deployed) → FRE-523 (eval-mode memory bug) **← next** → FRE-517 (per-topology rows) → FRE-522 (eval⇄PWA + tool-render). Non-build: FRE-505 ✅ verified+closed · FRE-453 re-sequenced behind FRE-541 (rubric waits on the conversation driver).

**Deploy cadence (master, owner-approved, one-at-a-time from main):** *Gateway* (526/528/523/517 + 518 backend) — batch by surface; joinability probe after any emit/schema/memory ticket. *Worker/terraform* (527/530) — independent surface. *PWA* (518/522/532) — serialize, bump `CACHE_NAME`, gateway rebuild ≠ PWA deploy. *Telemetry* — no prod deploy; local apply + commit templates + NDJSON.
**Contention guardrails:** PWA is the shared resource (518/522/532) → one lane owns it at a time, land 518 first. `pytest` lock = one `make test` at a time → throughput cap. `artifact_tools.py` touched by 526+528 (same lane, sequential). Merge server-side; deploy from main one at a time.

## Needs Approval

> **Architecture review (2026-06-26 — `docs/superpowers/plans/the-following-information-comes-logical-pie.md`, adr session) → 7 new items FRE-591…597 below, all owner-triage-for-placement.** A 16-item external design-review was verified against the live tree and triaged. Sequenced **behind the active Lane A/B observability streams, EXCEPT FRE-591 (A1 bug — file by criticality, ahead of the streams)**. The 3 design forks (**ADR-0094** local/cloud routing · **ADR-0095** grammar-constrained delegation · **ADR-0096** memory access model) + the DOC-4 rename note stay with the **adr session** — impl tickets only after each ADR is approved. §5 refuted/already-satisfied items + REF-1/REF-2 NOT filed (notes only). Owner owns the Approved gate.

Refutes the review's "active-vs-passive, pick one" framing — both paths are on + uncoordinated; assigns roles instead: passive=ambient floor (ADR-0081), active=on-demand precision (via ADR-0095 tool boundary), + de-dup coordination. Measure-first: D1 access-path attribution + de-dup → D2 tune the mix (**hard prereq FRE-593**) → D3 consolidation-quality lean (research). Umbrella FRE-618; impl FRE-613–617 Needs-Approval (whole chain gated on FRE-593). Completes the triage §4 fork (0094/0095/0096).** |
