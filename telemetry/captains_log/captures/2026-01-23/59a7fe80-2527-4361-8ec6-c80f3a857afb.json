  "user_message": "Where does the expression The Price of Tea in China come from. Search the internet if you do not know",
  "assistant_response": "I cannot search the internet or access external information. However, I can provide general knowledge based on existing information in my training data. \n\n\"The Price of Tea in China\" is a well-known English expression often used metaphorically to represent the idea that something is priced or valued in a way that seems unreasonable or exaggerated. It is not directly tied to a specific historical origin, but rather it has become a cultural idiom in English-speaking contexts.\n\nIt is often used humorously or ironically to highlight the absurdity of a price, such as when something is priced very high for a seemingly small or simple item. The phrase may have originated from a misunderstanding or misquotation of an actual Chinese proverb or expression, but there is no definitive source linking it directly to China's tea culture or historical pricing.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help explore more about the cultural or linguistic background of such expressions. Let me know!",
