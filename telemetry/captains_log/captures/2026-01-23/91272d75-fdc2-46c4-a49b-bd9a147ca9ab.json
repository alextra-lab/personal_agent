  "assistant_response": "The expression \"The Price of Tea in China\" originates as a sarcastic phrase used to dismiss irrelevant or off-topic comments. It evolved from earlier expressions like \"What's that got to do with the price of [commodity]?\" (e.g., eggs, fish, cheese) dating back to at least 1832. The specific version involving \"tea in China\" became common between 1895 and 1930, likely due to China's well-known tea monopoly and frequent references to tea prices in 19th-century British discussions—such as in the House of Commons. The phrase gained widespread use in American English by the 20th century, with roots possibly tied to early British or Australian usage of \"not for all the tea in China.\" Today, it functions as a humorous or dismissive idiom, and similar expressions like \"the price of eggs in Russia\" are now used as variants.",
